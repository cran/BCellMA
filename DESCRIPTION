Description: Includes a set of functions to analyze for instance nucleotide frequencies as well as transition and  transversion. Can reconstruct germline sequences based on the international ImMunoGeneTics information system (IMGT/HighV-QUEST) outputs, calculate and plot the difference (%) of nucleotides at 6 positions around a mutation to identify and characterize hotspot motifs as well as calculate and plot average mutation frequencies of nucleotide mutations resulting in amino acid substitution.
